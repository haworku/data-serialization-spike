# data-serialize-test

Comparing protobuf (Google) and avro (Apache) with some contrived examples

## Why

We have data stored in complex structures that is changing over time. We want to easily understand the structure of the data at the time it was stored, ideally referencing a schema.

## Comparison checklist

- file type
- installation/usage notes
- what does typescript support look like
- how do you add remove fields over time
- note on usage with graphq
